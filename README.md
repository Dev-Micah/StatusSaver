# StatusSaver - WhatsApp Status Saver App

**StatusSaver** is an Android application built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** that enables users to view, save, and manage **WhatsApp statuses** (images and videos) directly from their devices. Designed for performance and simplicity, it uses modern Android tools and patterns to support both older and newer versions of Android — including Scoped Storage and the Storage Access Framework (SAF).
